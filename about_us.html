        <h2 class="paragraph_mini_title">Who we are</h2>
        <p>
            The Kappa Mu Chapter of Sigma Chi was founded on April 9th, 1994. At the time it is the 228th chapter and
            ninth
            in Canada.
            <br><br>
            Located at the University of Windsor, in Windsor, Ontario, the Kappa Mu Chapter is the preeminent collegiate
            leadership development organization on its campus.
            <br><br>
            The chapter is active in both terms of the year. It holds numerous philanthropic, fundraising and social
            events
            in and around the Windsor area.
            <br><br>
            The chapter currently has 13 active members and 299 alumni.
            <br><br>

        <h2 class="paragraph_mini_title">Timeless Principles</h2>
        <br>

        <h3 class="h3_title">FRIENDSHIP</h3>
        <p>
            When the Founders came together to form the Fraternity in 1855, one of the core beliefs that each shared
            with the group was a mutual belief in the idea of true friendship. They believed that true friendship is
            best found through true service to each other by working to lift each other up to be the best versions of
            themselves. Their quality of character and their practice of core values and proper manners formed a
            close-knit brotherhood, very similar to the one we promote as a General Fraternity today. We pursue the
            ideal of friendship through the emulation of character qualities embodied in the Ritual, and we aim to help
            our fellow brothers achieve their goals as well.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="h3_title">JUSTICE</h3>
        <p>
            We continuously pursue the aim of Justice through a commitment of every member of Sigma Chi to promote
            fairness, decency and good will through our every interaction. Further, justice is found within Sigma Chi
            through the observance of the Fraternity's governing laws and through adherence to the decisions of our
            legislative assemblies, which empower and direct our leadership. Doing the right thing, above anything else,
            was the sole reason for the birth of the Fraternity and that spirit echoes in Sigma Chi today.
        </p>

        </div>
        <br>

        <h3 class="h3_title">LEARNING</h3>
        <p>
            Sigma Chi believes that learning is constant and is not linear. Rather, the process of learning is gradual -
            beginning with our earliest days, stretching through our college days, and never-ending throughout our
            lifetime. In Sigma Chi, each man completes a period of education devoted to understanding the Fraternity's
            unique history, traditions and practices, which culminates in an opportunity to accept a lifelong commitment
            to the Fraternity and the achievement of its purpose. Along with promoting academic success, the Fraternity
            also best serves its purpose by developing and implementing world-class programs that foster leadership,
            build character and promote positive relationship skills, which, in turn, enable our members to become
            learned, productive and caring participants in their families, colleges and communities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph" style="clear: both;">
        <h2 class="paragraph_mini_title">What we do</h2>
        <p>
            The fundamental purpose of our fraternity is the cultivation, achievement, and maintenance of the ideals of
            friendship, justice and learning.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="h3_title">Academics</h3>
        <p>
            A requirement for each of our brothers is to maintain a 70 percent or higher cumulative grade average. The
            Scholarship Chair is responsible for monitoring the grades of each brother on a bi-annual basis.
            <br><br>
            The Leddy Library at the University of Windsor is a common area for brothers to study together, but brothers
            will also arrange group study sessions at our chapter house or reserve classrooms in Dillon Hall or the
            Odette Building.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="h3_title">Conduct</h3>
        <p>
            Each brother of Sigma Chi is required to reflect the fraternity's values in their daily lives. As such,
            brothers are encouraged to follow the <span class="bold_text">Jordan Standard</span> - a set of ideals which
            produce prosperous gentlemen
            when followed. In fact, new members, or 'rushes', are considered for pledgeship (the next process for
            joining the fraternity) based on how they meet the Jordan Standard.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3_title">Philanthropy</h3>
        <p>
            Each fraternity and sorority chooses a designated charity to which they primarily donate. The Kappa Mu
            chapter
            designated the <a class="paragraph_social_link normal_link"
                href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/">Huntsman Cancer Institute</a> as its primary
            charitable organization. Apart from numerous events
            throughout the year, the Kappa Mu chapter hosts two annual philanthropic events: Derby Days and Hot
            Tub-A-Thon.
